# Contributing

## Found a bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to ou GitLab Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* Small Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

## Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).


## Commit rules
* 50 characters maximum
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Add a pull request/merge request tracking ID (if needed)
* Use gitmoji (because it's coooooool)
* One task by commit
* Rebase how many times you want, cleaner is better.
